# What is post-digital

The post-digital artist selected for discussion is Jess Herrington, known for her innovative work that exemplifies the integration of digital and physical art forms. One of her notable pieces, Draw Jelly, merges the contemporary art style of Yayoi Kusama—characterized by her iconic dotted paintings and sculptures—with augmented reality (AR) to create an interactive experience. In this work, a 3D pink jelly object is rendered within one of Kusama’s signature art rooms, effectively blending digital layers with physical space.

This concept aligns with the definition presented in Florian Cramer’s essay, which states, “The term ‘post-digital’ in its simplest sense describes the messy state of media, arts and design after their digitisation (or at least the digitisation of crucial aspects of the channels through which they are communicated)” (Cramer, 2014). Herrington’s incorporation of AR into a contemporary artist's physical environment clearly illustrates her significance as a post-digital artist.

Jess Harrington utilises Augmented Reality (AR) to create “Draw Jelly.” She integrates 3D objects into real spaces, such as Yayoi Kusama’s art installations. Herrington's artwork likely employs Unity and AR.js to render the 3D jelly. Hypothetically, she may have used JavaScript engines like three.js and AR.js, combined with other software such as the WebXR API or Unity, to create her artwork.
