q5.js is a beginner-friendly learning library that is compatible with p5.js. There are many clubs to join that serve as learning platforms, covering a wide range of genres from apps and software to comedy and illustration.

c2.js is similar to q5.js; however, it is primarily based on a JavaScript library for creative coding. It utilises geometric shapes, simulations, algorithms, and other modules to create digital interactive artworks.

SVG.js is a platform that uses code to create animated images. It offers a faster and more efficient method of coding, as it is easier to read and requires less code to animate an image.

Q5.js is a JavaScript learning platform that is compatible with p5.js. Q5.js could be used within a JavaScript library through ESM. Additionally, Svg.js can be utilised within a JavaScript module, as it is an XML-based vector format for graphics and images. This library can manipulate DOM and SVG elements effectively. On the other hand, c2.js is written in TypeScript and is released as a JavaScript library. It is primarily used for generating data visualisations, sound visuals, and generative design. Therefore, c2.js can also be integrated into a JavaScript library.

In this context, a tool like esm.sh can be especially useful. esm.sh acts as a CDN that converts npm packages into ES modules, making them easier to import directly into your JavaScript projects without extra bundling. This is ideal when working with modern development environments like Deno or writing JavaScript modules that need clean, importable packages. So, if one of the libraries you’re using doesn’t natively support ES modules, esm.sh helps bridge that gap, making integration smoother and more modular-friendly.

# Information and thinking

All living things emit, store, and receive information, and thinking is all about receiving, emitting, storing, and processing it. According to Michel Serres, True information is rare, creative, and life-affirming, in contrast to the repetitive, death-focused media we encounter on a daily basis. The information provided in this article displays the foundation of existence.

Michel Serres discusses that Information circulates through different networks such as natural, human, and technological. This creates a complex web that links everything from ancient roads to modern digital systems and the structures of life itself. Serres believes that the universe is comprised of both matter and information, enabling all entities to express, perceive, and relate to the world. Nature, also thinks and records through wind, water, rock, and even atoms, demonstrating that we share these capabilities with the world around us.

Serres mentioned that even in a dazzling crystal grotto, two heroes are overwhelmed by the vibrant formations that reflect nature's imagination. In philosophy, one often mistakes daylight as a symbol of absolute truth, but true thinking resembles the night, which is filled with shifting, interconnected truths like stars in the sky. This perspective provides a more inclusive space for understanding.

Immanuel Kant’s "Sun-Ego" philosophy, which centres knowledge around the subject, is limiting, especially considering modern astrophysics that reveals a vast universe. In Verne's cave, gems, matter, and the cosmos exchange information, showing that reality is a network of reflection. Knowledge involves understanding these connected languages, often expressed through mathematics.

# WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A FUNGUS?

Fungi are foundational to life, acting both as decomposers and essential in ecosystems like the ‘wood wide web’ that links over 90% of plants. Since the earth was in the process of being reshaped with volcanic islands and glaciers, fungi helped to form new ecosystems, and create new life where land is newly formed. Because of their adaptability, fungi are able to thrive in different environments which ranges from explosive spore launches to mycelium networks located underground.

Fungi assist the environment and humans. They have impacted our past, starting from the era of Neanderthals when they consumed fungi as food, to the invention of penicillin which changed medicine. Now, fungi help in solving environmental challenges, in cleaning oil spills, and replacing mycelium with plastics. Economically, the market for edible fungi is rapidly expanding, and is expected to experience new growth.

During his research expedition in Panama’s tropical forests Merlin Sheldrake focused on studying mycorrhizal associations. Fieldwork unpredictability resembled the complexity of the ‘wood wide web’ which involved stormy weather and challenging terrain. His fascination with Voyria flowers which survive without photosynthesis thanks to fungi deepened his understanding of fungi's impact on life.

Fungi’s role goes beyond biology. Fungi prompt us to rethink established concepts of individual identity and cognitive abilities. Fungi demonstrate alternative approaches to problem-solving and communication that reshape our understanding of ecosystems. Field research combined with LSD trial experiences has reshaped my life perspective to embrace nature’s complexity through open and imaginative exploration.

# Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation

Xenofeminism stands as a transformative movement that reshapes feminist principles to fit a technologically evolved society. This view counters the belief that oppression is an inherent or unavoidable condition by demonstrating the possibility of intentional change within societal structures and biological systems. This approach requires more than passive resistance because it involves actively remaking technology, science and infrastructure to take down power structures such as patriarchy capitalism and white supremacy.

Xenofeminism pushes for comprehensive system-wide transformation rather than limited reforms or identity-based battles. This perspective identifies political battlegrounds in biohacking and DIY medicine while also recognizing similar potential in urban design and digital networks. Through pragmatic, collective action the movement experiments with contradictions while dismissing the ideals of purity and nostalgia.

Xenofeminism operates on the principle that no aspect of society or biology is beyond transformation including gender standards and economic systems as well as natural limitations. Our focus extends beyond simply criticizing current systems to actively constructing new futures through reasoned planning, technological advancements, and coordinated effort to develop a world free from oppressive foundations. To enact meaningful change you need urgent actions and long-term plans which integrate immediate steps with patient efforts to transform reality.
