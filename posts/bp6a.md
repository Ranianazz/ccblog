q5.js is a beginner-friendly learning library that is compatible with p5.js. There are many clubs to join that serve as learning platforms, covering a wide range of genres from apps and software to comedy and illustration.

c2.js is similar to q5.js; however, it is primarily based on a JavaScript library for creative coding. It utilises geometric shapes, simulations, algorithms, and other modules to create digital interactive artworks.

SVG.js is a platform that uses code to create animated images. It offers a faster and more efficient method of coding, as it is easier to read and requires less code to animate an image.
