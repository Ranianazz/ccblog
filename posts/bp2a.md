My interpretation of cuteness often resembles big, round eyes that sparkle. After our class discussion, I learned that soft colours and rounded shapes are commonly associated with a cute aesthetic. We also talked about movement, and we all agreed that cuteness can be linked to excitement. To capture this idea, I plan to make my interactive objects bounce around the screen, similar to how a child feels when they see a ball bounce for the first time.

As a huge Pok√©mon fan, I noticed that their cute aesthetic breaks away from traditional norms because they use bright colours. In my p5.js sketch, I will also incorporate bright colours, as I believe that something can be both cute and exciting at the same time. Therefore, my sketch will feature round objects that bounce around the screen, embodying both cuteness and excitement.

When considering sound elements that align with a cute aesthetic, it's effective to incorporate soft or subtle tones. Sounds such as children's giggles or gentle music can complement this theme beautifully, enhancing the overall ambiance and evoking a sense of warmth and playfulness. In my sketch, I plan to incorporate children's giggles to add to the cute aesthetic.
