# How did Rafael Rozendaal achive a cute aethtic register?

Refael incorporates geometric shapes in many of his artworks. He uses soft, bright pastel colors and rounded forms to create a visually appealing, cute aesthetic. By slowing down the speed of some of the artworks, he achieves a softer atmosphere that conveys a sense of cuteness.

In terms of sound, most of his cute artworks are silent. From my perspective, pieces like "Clash," "Non-Either," "Float," "Bounce," and "Fill This Up" lack a sonic aesthetic.

Nonetheless, the interactivity of his work is enjoyable and playful, contributing to the overall cute aesthetic, as cute elements are often fun and engaging.

# How I will achieve a cute aesthetic register.

To create a visually appealing aesthetic, I plan to use round shapes to design a cat that incorporates Pikachu's signature yellow colour along with red checks, resulting in an incredibly cute image.

To further engage my viewers and enhance the cute aesthetic, I will include the sound of children's laughter.

For interactivity, I will implement a bounce function that allows my adorable Pikachu cat to giggle and bounce around the screen.
