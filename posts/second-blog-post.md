# This is a second blog post!

This post is a homework assignment that demonstrates my attempts at
creating a grid of squares. The first thing I did was search on Google for
how to create a grid of squares in p5. The search results led me to a
YouTube tutorial that helped me understand the process. I then came across
some code in p5, which I copied into my existing code. However, this
caused an error due to the placement of the code.
