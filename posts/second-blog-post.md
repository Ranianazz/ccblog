# This is a second blog post!

This post is a homework assignment that showcases my attempts at creating a grid of squares. First, I searched Google for guidance on how to create a grid of squares in p5.js. The search results led me to a YouTube tutorial that helped me understand the process.

I then came across some p5.js code, which I copied into my existing project. Unfortunately, this caused an error due to the placement of the code. To resolve this, I utilized ChatGPT to generate code that would accomplish what I needed. However, I felt unsatisfied with the result because it wasn't my own work.

Later, I asked Thomas for further guidance to help me understand JavaScript better. He spent significant time explaining the language in detail, which was helpful. However, since JavaScript is like learning a new language, it will take me some time to fully grasp the concepts.

For now, the two examples shown below are the completed homework tasks assigned to my class.

This gride was achieved by adding const t = frameCount / 25; which is a Time-based variable for animation and
