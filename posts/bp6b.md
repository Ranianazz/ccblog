# WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A FUNGUS by Merlin Sheldrake

"Some fungi, like the yeasts that ferment sugar into alcohol and cause
bread to rise, consist of single cells that multiply by budding into two.
However, most fungi form networks of many cells known as hyphae
(pronounced HY fee): fine tubular structures that branch, fuse, and tangle
into the anarchic filigree of mycelium. Mycelium describes the most
common of fungal habits, better thought of not as a thing but as a process:
an exploratory, irregular tendency. Water and nutrients flow through
ecosystems within mycelial networks. The mycelium of some fungal
species is electrically excitable and conducts waves of electrical activity
along hyphae, analogous to the electrical impulses in animal nerve cells.
