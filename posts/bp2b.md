# My kindered spirit !

My kindred spirit feels like home. We share a deep love for our faith and culture, finding joy in the little things such as food, movies, and gaming. Our bond merges faith, fun, and comfort, making him my partner in both meaningful and lighthearted moments.

# context of our kinship

My kinship is rooted in a shared connection to faith, culture, and comfort. The bond with my kindred spirit is strengthened by our mutual love for Islam and Palestinian culture, which grounds us in our identity and heritage. Together, we find joy in the little thingsâ€”such as traditional food, comedy movies, and gaming, this brings fun and comfort to our relationship. Whether we are sharing meaningful moments or lighthearted ones. Our connection thrives on a balance of spirituality, cultural, and everyday life. In a world that often misunderstands or challenges our identity, we support each other in staying true to our roots, making our connection feel like home, no matter where we are.

# Common Purpose

Our common purpose is to support each other in maintaining our identity in a world that often misunderstands it. Living in Western society, we often find ourselves caught between two cultures: our faith and heritage, and the pressures of modern life. There are times when we lose touch with our faith as we become too involved in contemporary society, but this is when we remind each other of the values that define us. Together, we strive to hold onto our identity, keeping our faith and heritage alive, while navigating the challenges of modern life. This shared struggle and mutual support strengthen our bond and give us a sense of purpose.

# Shared Challenge / Adversary

Our shared challenge is navigating life in a Western society that often misunderstands or marginalizes our faith and cultural identity. The pressures of modern life, along with the pull of contemporary society, sometimes make it difficult to stay connected to our roots. We face the struggle of balancing our Islamic faith and Palestinian heritage with the demands and expectations of the world around us. Together, we work to overcome these challenges, reminding each other of our values and supporting one another in staying true to who we are.

# p5 sketches that explains my idea.

My kindred spirit shares a deep connection to Islam, and I created this sketch to reflect that bond while symbolizing hope for Palestine. The design features rotating Palestinian-inspired flowers/stars in gold, representing their significance in Islamic culture. Hidden beneath the moon is the word "Allah," which is revealed only when the moon is clicked.

To build this, I used setup() to create a 400x400 canvas and draw() to render the animation based on the state of showText. The rotating Islamic patterns were created using drawPattern() and frameCount \* 0.01 for smooth motion. The crescent moon, made with drawMoon(), uses a smaller green circle overlaid on a larger golden one, while drawStar() adds a small star nearby. I used ChatGPT to help develop the mouse-click function and fix errors to achieve the desired effect.
