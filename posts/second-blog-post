    <h1>this is a second blog post!</h1>
    <p>
      This post is a homework assignment that demonstrates my attempts at
      creating a grid of squares. The first thing I did was search on Google for
      how to create a grid of squares in p5. The search results led me to a
      YouTube tutorial that helped me understand the process. I then came across
      some code in p5, which I copied into my existing code. However, this
      caused an error due to the placement of the code.
